## The Story

Herenui Tokoragi, a brilliant Tahitian astrophysicist, makes a discovery that will transform humanity: an extraterrestrial vessel buried deep in the Pacific Ocean. Together with Teiki, she uncovers an ancestral link between Polynesian navigators and the Te'reith, an advanced extraterrestrial civilization.

A space mission is launched toward Matairea, a world located 42 light-years away. There, in a cosmic library left by the "Sowers," the crew will discover that humanity's destiny is intimately linked to a galactic project whose roots plunge into the depths of Polynesian antiquity.
